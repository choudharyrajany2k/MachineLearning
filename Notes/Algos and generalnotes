classification 
------------------
	- classes are know before classification is done e.g wether a mail is a spam or not a spam
	- This requires training i.e supervised learning
	examples for algorithms - 
		-naive bayes, 
		-Support vector algorithms, 
		-decision tree, 
		-neural networks, 
		-logistic regression,
		-Random forests
		-K nearest Neighbors
	classification prolems
		- Spam Detection -  spam or ham ?
		- Sentiment Ananlysis -  positive sentiment or negative sentiment
		-Trading Strategy- Up day or Down Day
		
Training data -  a set of data where the class is already known. 

Sentimental analysis - ploarity of the comment

 Customer behaviour
 Customer churn(stop using the service or continue the service) fraud detection, crdit risk

clustering
--------------
	- classes are not known. The identification for a particular cluster happens based on the attributes e.g classify a group of animals species. a mammale, reptile, bird e.t.c
	- This is unsupervised learning.
	examples - k-mean, k-medoids, density based, hierarchical e.t.c
